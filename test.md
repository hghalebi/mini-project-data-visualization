# Introduction\n\nIn this analysis, we will explore the trends of baby names during the early 20th century and investigate if there are any correlations with political or social changes. We will examine the number of births for five consecutive years from 1900 to 1904. Our objective is to identify interesting facts and determine if changes in naming trends align with broader societal shifts during this period.\n\n# Data Analysis\n\nLet's start by examining the data provided:\n\n| Year | Number of Births |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1900 | 49,752          |\n| 1901 | 53,177          |\n| 1902 | 52,889          |\n| 1903 | 51,443          |\n| 1904 | 51,075          |\n\n## Trend Analysis\n\nTo better understand the trend of baby names during this period, let's visualize the data using a line chart:\n\n[Insert line chart]\n\nFrom the line chart, we can observe that the number of births remained relatively stable between 1900 and 1904. There is no significant increase or decrease in the number of births during this period.\n\n## Correlation Analysis\n\nNext, let's investigate if there are any correlations between the naming trends and political or social changes during the early 20th century. We will consider key events and trends during this period and analyze if there are any corresponding shifts in baby name preferences.\n\n### 1. Political Changes\n\n#### World War I (1914-1918)\n\nAlthough the dataset only includes data until 1904, it is worth considering the potential impact of World War I on naming trends. The war had a significant impact on society, and it is possible that parents may have chosen different names for their children during or after the war.\n\n### 2. Social Changes\n\n#### Women's Suffrage Movement\n\nThe early 20th century was a time of significant progress for women's rights, including the suffrage movement. Women fought for and eventually gained the right to vote during this period. It would be interesting to explore if there are any naming trends that reflect this social change.\n\n#### Industrialization and Urbanization\n\nThe early 20th century also saw rapid industrialization and urbanization. People moved from rural areas to cities, and this shift in lifestyle may have influenced naming trends. It would be interesting to investigate if there are any naming trends that align with this societal change.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBased on the data provided, we observed that the number of births remained relatively stable between 1900 and 1904. However, to fully understand the correlation between naming trends and political or social changes, we need to consider events and trends beyond the scope of the dataset.\n\nTo further explore this topic, additional data from a broader time period and context would be necessary. This analysis provides a starting point for investigating the relationship between naming trends and societal shifts, but further research is required to draw more definitive conclusions.
